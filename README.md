## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project I could practice important CSS concepts, as display flex and display grid

### Continued development

Talking about the future, my plans for continued development are all around an solid formation at the main front end development skill set. This implies on making more project like this one, to put in practice all relevant knowledge about HTML and CSS; learn and perfect JavaScript; learn about React etc.

### Useful resources

- [My HTML and CSS Summary](https://just-patch-a6b.notion.site/Resumo-De-Aulas-do-DevQuest-4092469f5cb04a3a913b87cd3d7601b4) - Those are the notes (they are in Portuguese) I made about the classes I watched on the "Dev em Dobro" online training, for Front End dev formation

## About the Author

Since I'm a simple Padawan when it comes to front end development, there is not much to talk about me on that context. I'm just a guy trying hard to learn how to programm and make this a carreer.
